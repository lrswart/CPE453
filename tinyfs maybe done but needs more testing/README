For file allocation I used Indexed Allocation. The structure IndexBlock holds all blocks that belong to a file.

All file index blocks are stored in a single FileTable structure, always put in block 1. FileTable holds 28 filename/blocknumber pairs, and a blocknumber for the next FileTable if more than 28 files are stored on the disk. (more than 28 files needs testing)

Free blocks are kept track of using a linked list approach. The superblock holds the location of the first free block, and every free block holds the position of the next free block in the list. When blocks are freed they are put at the head of the list, which means the superblock is rewritten so that its first free block field holds the location of the newly freed block.
